### GETTING STARTED
Remember the package.json file is copied over without all the package library files.

**NOTE:** Customise the scripts as need for the build process.

Install the libraries
```
$ npm install
```

Start the development server
```
$ npm run start
```

### BASIC SETUP
* Simplified architecture
* CSS custom properties instead of SASS variables
  -> Don't need a preprocessor.
  -> Can be manipulated in JS and DevTools.
  -> Easier to use in the calc function.
  -> Cascade and are inherited.
